# Coupleable

This class provides API for coupling different kinds of variables values into MOOSE systems.
The following table summarizes the methods and kinds of values they provide:

| Method | Description |
| - | - |
coupledValue | Values of a coupled variable in q-points
coupledGradient | Gradients of a coupled variable in q-points
coupledSecond | Second derivatives of a coupled variable in q-points
coupledNodalValue | Values of a coupled variable at nodes.
coupledVectorValue | Values of a coupled vector variable in q-points
coupledCurl | Curl of a coupled vector variable in q-points
coupledDot | Time derivative of a coupled variable
coupledDotDu | Derivative of a time derivative of a coupled variable
coupledNodalDot | Nodal value of the time derivative of a coupled variable
coupledVectorDot | Time derivative of a coupled vector variable

For values, gradients and second derivatives, users can request old and older values in case they are running a transient simulation.
In case of old and older values, the methods are called `coupledValueOld` and `coupledValueOlder`, respectively.
Similarly,

## Optional Coupling

To determine if a variable was coupled, users can use `isCoupled` method.
The typical use case looks like this:

```
_value(isCoupled("v") ? coupledValue("v") : _zero)
```

However, this use case became obsolete and now it is recommended to use default values for optionally coupled variables, see the following example:

```
validParams<Class>()
{
  InputParameters params = validParams<BaseClass>();
  params.addCoupledVar("v", 2., "Coupled value");
  ...
}

Class::Class(...) : BaseClass(...),
  _v(coupledValue('v'))
```

The advantage here is that users can provide arbitrary default values to their variables.

## Coupling of Vectors of Variables

Users can couple a vector of variables using the following syntax:

```
v = 'a b c'
```

This syntax provides 3 variables coupled as a variable `v` in a MOOSE object using the `Coupleable` interface.
The number of components coupled into can be obtained by `coupledComponents` method.
Then, individual components can be obtained by calling `coupledValue` (or any other method mentioned above) passing in the variable name (as usual) and the component index. See the following example:

Declarations:

```
class B : public A
{
  ...
protected:
  unsigned int _n_vars;
  std::vector<MooseVariable *> _vars;
};
```

Implementation:

```
validParams<B>()
{
  InputParameters params = validParams<A>();
  params.addRequiredCoupledVar("v", "Coupled value");
  ...
}

B::B(...) : A(...),
  _n_vars(coupledComponents("v"))
{
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < _n_vars; i++)
    _vars.push_back(dynamic_cast<MooseVariable *>(getVar("v", i)));
}
```

## Defaults for Coupling of Vectors of Variables

Vectors of variables can be added using `params.addCoupledVar` as described above. The parameter class allows providing
defaults for vector variables as follows:

```
validParams<B>()
{
  InputParameters params = validParams<A>();
  params.addCoupledVar("v", {1, 2, 3}, "Coupled value");
  ...
}
```

Coupled variable parameters can be set to constant real numbers in the input file using the syntax

```
v = '1'
```

for a single coupled variable or using

```
v = '1 2 3'
```

for a vector of coupled variables. Currently mixing actual variable assignments and defaults like this:

```
v = '1 actual_var 3'
```

is not supported.
