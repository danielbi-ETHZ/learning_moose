# 1-D Gap Heat Transfer Test without mechanics
#
# This test exercises 1-D gap heat transfer for a constant conductivity gap.
#
# The mesh consists of two element blocks in the x-y plane.  Each element block
# is a square. They sit next to one another with a unit between them.
#
# The conductivity of both blocks is set very large to achieve a uniform temperature
# across each block. The temperature of the far bottom boundary
# is ramped from 100 to 200 over one time unit.  The temperature of the far top
# boundary is held fixed at 100.
#
# A simple analytical solution is possible for the heat flux between the blocks:
#
# Flux = (T_left - T_right) * (gapK/gap_width)
#
# The gap conductivity is specified as 1, thus
#
# gapK(Tavg) = 1.0*Tavg
#
# The heat flux across the gap at time = 1 is then:
#
# Flux = 100 * (1.0/1.0) = 100
#
# For comparison, see results from the flux post processors.  These results
# are the same as for the unit 1-D gap heat transfer between two unit cubes.
