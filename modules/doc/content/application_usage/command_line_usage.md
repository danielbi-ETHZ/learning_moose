# Command-Line Usage

## Command-Line Options

All MOOSE-based applications come with quite a few command-line options.  These can be customized by each application by adding "Command Line Parameters" to their `MooseApp` derived object.

Command-line options can be set using either short syntax such as `-i inputfile.i` or longer syntax with either `--long-option value` or `--long-option=value`.  If spaces are needed for the value then you need to quote them like `--long-option='value1 value2'`.  If using the `=` it's important not to put any space around it.

To print out the available command-line options use `--help`.  An example from MooseTest looks like this:

```
> ./moose_test-opt --help

Usage: ./moose_test-opt [<options>]

Options:
  --check-input                                     Check the input file (i.e. requires -i <filename>) and quit.

## Important Options

Below are a few important command-line options you should be aware of:

### `-i`

The most important option is `-i` this is how you specify an input file to read like so:

```
./yourapp-opt -i input.i
```

It's always important to `cd` to the directory where your input file is so that relative paths within the input file are treated properly.

### `--dump`

`--dump` will show you all of the available input file syntax for your application.  This can be quite overwhelming so `--dump` can optionally take an argument for a piece of syntax to search for like so:

```
./yourapp-opt --dump SomeKernel
```

Would show you documentation for objects matching `SomeKernel`.

### `--recover`

If you output checkpoint files (using `checkpoint = true` in your `Outputs` block in your input file) then `--recover` will allow you to continue a solve that died in the middle of the solve.  This can allow you to recover a job that was killed because the power went out or your job ran out of time on the cluster you were using.

Again: you *MUST* turn on `checkpoint = true` in the `Outputs` block of your input file for this to work!  We now recommend that all input files contain `checkpoint = true`.

### `--n-threads`

`--n-threads` controls the number of threads per MPI process MOOSE will use for the computation.  This is how you turn on shared-memory parallelism.

## Command-Line Input File Overrides

Any input file parameters can be overriden/set from the command-line.  This is incredibly handy for scripting and parameter studies.  The way it works is that you use a "directory" type of syntax.  Let's say that you have this `[Kernels]` block in your input file:

```conf
[Kernels]
  [./akernel]
    type = MyKernel
    variable = somevar
    coefficient = 0.2
  [../]
[]
```

To set the value of `coefficient` from the command-line you would run your application like so:

```
./yourapp-opt -i theinput.i Kernels/akernel/coefficient=0.7
```

It's important to remember not to use any spaces when doing command-line overrides like this.
