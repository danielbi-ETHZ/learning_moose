# Tracked Apps

MOOSE is designed for buiding custom applications, the following is a communiy driven list of applications.

The purpose of these lists is two fold:

1. Every MOOSE-based application is a library, thus it is natural to create new applications from existing code.
1. The MOOSE developpers strive to keep your applicatios up-to-date when major changes occur, this list indicates to the developpers to consider your application.
