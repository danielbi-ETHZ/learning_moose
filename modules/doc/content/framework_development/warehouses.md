# Warehouses

The warehouse objects (based on
[MooseObjectWarehouseBase](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/devel/framework/include/base/MooseObjectWarehouseBase.h))
in MOOSE hold onto the objects that are built by the factory.  They are templated so they can hold
any of the types of objects the Factory can build.

The main purpose is to accelerate retrieval of sets of objects needed during assembly.  To this
end, they have many accessors on them such as `getActiveObjects()`.  Internally, these sets of
objects are cached to make retrieval quick.

## TheWarehouse

Work is currently being undertaken to migrate MOOSE to use a new warehouse architecture.
UserObjects have already been migrated.  In the new architecture there is only a single warehouse
instance (TheWarehouse) through which all object queries can be made.

TheWarehouse is a class that holds and manages memory for MooseObjects - allowing flexible
querying to select subsets of objects.  TheWarehouse stores customizeable meta-data for each
object that queries operate on. In general, meta-data is treated as static and not updated after
objects have been added.  Results are cached and reused for repeated identical queries. For more
information on the API and usage, see the doxygen documentation
[here](http://mooseframework.org/docs/doxygen/moose/classAuxGroupExecuteMooseObjectWarehouse.html).

## MooseObjectWarehouse

[MooseObjectWarehouse](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/devel/framework/include/base/MooseObjectWarehouse.h)
is based on `MooseObjectWarehouseBase` but adds important functionality for objects that support
the
[SetupInterface](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/devel/framework/include/base/SetupInterface.h).
In addition, there is a bit of functionality there for holding sets of Kernels that go with each
`MooseVariable` to make retrieving them quick for Jacobian calculations.

There is some trickiness in `addObject()`.  To support `getActiveVariableBlockObjects()` we want
to have a `Warehouse` for each variable Kernel's are acting on.  To do that, we have nested
`MooseObjectWarehouse`s which we add to in `addObject()`.  However, we need the recursion to stop
after one level so we can pass `recurse = false` to keep it from recursing to death.
