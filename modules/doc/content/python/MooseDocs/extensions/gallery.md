# Gallery Extension

The gallery extension provides a mechanism for creating "cards" using the 'card' command and
allow for these items to be organized in to a gallery with the 'gallery' command. The
available configuration items for the extension are listed below, in [gallery-config].

!devel settings module=MooseDocs.extensions.gallery
                object=GalleryExtension
                id=gallery-config
                caption=Configuration items for the alert extension.

## Cards

In general, a gallery is composed of cards; however, the 'card' command works as a stand
alone command. The name card is derived from the [materialize](https://materializecss.com/cards.html)
framework, which MOOSEDocs relies for creating website content. The settings for the
card command are listed in [card-settings].

!devel! example id=gallery-example-card
               caption=Example use of the 'card' command.
!card level_set/vortex_out.gif title=Vortex Benchmark style=width:50%;
The level set equation is commonly used to for interface tracking, especially when the interface
velocity is known. MOOSE contains a level set module, for more information see [level_set/index.md].

## Gallery

A gallery is simply a collection of cards, to create a gallery simply wrap the card commands
with a block-level gallery command as shown below. The available settings for the gallery command
are listed in [gallery-settings].
