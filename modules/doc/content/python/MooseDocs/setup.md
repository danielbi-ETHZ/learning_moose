# MooseDocs Setup

Any MOOSE-based application can use the MooseDocs system to create custom websites. If a current
[MOOSE package](getting_started/index.md) is installed then the necessary dependencies
exist. Also, if you have recently created an application with stork (after Aug. 15,
2018) then your application will have the files for a simple website created. The sections below will
aid in setting up your application if you do not have the dependencies or the necessary documentation
files.

To build a live website for your application, run the following:

```bash
cd ~/projects/your_animal/doc
./moosedocs.py build --serve
```

When this command completes a message will be printed and the site will be hosted at
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000). Note, when new pages are added the build command will
need to be re-executed.

This executable contains command-line based help, which can be accessed using the "-h" flag as
follows.

```
cd ~/projects/your_animal/docs
./moosedocs.py -h
```

The configuration file contains information on how to build the website, additional details regarding
this file may be found at [MooseDocs/config.md].

Once you have a basic website running the next step is to document your code, it is best to refer to
the MOOSE instructions for documentation (see [MooseDocs/generate.md]). In general, applications
mimic the MOOSE process.

## Dependencies

If you are not using a MOOSE package or your package is old, then the following packages must be
installed, which can be done using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install --user pybtex livereload==2.5.1 pylatexenc anytree pandas
```

## Creating Documentation Files

If you have an existing application without a "doc" directory, then a few files must be created
before you can begin building a website.

First create a doc directory that contains the homepage for your application.

```bash
cd ~/project/your_animal
mkdir doc
mkdir doc/content
echo "# YourAnimalApp" > doc/content/index.md
```

Second, create the MooseDocs executable and configuration file. This is done by copying the files
used by the stork script.

```
cp ~/projects/moose/stork/doc/moosedocs.py ~/projects/your_animal/doc
cp ~/projects/moose/stork/doc/config.yml ~/projects/your_animal/doc
```
