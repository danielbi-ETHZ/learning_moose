# Chigger

The python "chigger" python library is framework for creating visualizations via scripts. The
package was created as a "mite to replace [EnSight](https://www.ensight.com/)." This package
is the basis of the Peacock result tab.

The chigger package is currently under heavy development to make the tools more interactive, via the
command-line, to create visualization scripts rapidly. So, please be patient as these changes take
shape as does the associated documentation.

If you are interested in using chigger, please refer to the tests (`moose/python/chigger/tests`)
until the documentation is complete.
