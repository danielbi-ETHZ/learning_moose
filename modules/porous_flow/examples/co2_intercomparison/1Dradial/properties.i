# Liquid and gas properties for code intercomparison problem 3
#
# From Pruess et al, Code intercomparison builds confidence in
# numerical simulation models for geologic disposal of CO2, Energy 29 (2004)
#
# This test simply calculates density and viscosity of each phase for
# various pressures and salinities, as well as mass fractions of CO2 in the
# liquid phase and H2O in the gas phase.
#
# Four versions of this are run:
# 1) No CO2, 0 salt mass fraction (pure water)
# 2) Enough CO2 to form gas phase, 0 salt mass fraction (pure water)
# 3) No CO2, 0.15 salt mass fraction
# 4) Enough CO2 to form gas phase, 0.15 salt mass fraction
#
# These results compare well with detailed results presented in Pruess et al,
# Intercomparison of numerical simulation codes for geologic disposal of CO2,
# LBNL-51813 (2002)
