# Dynamics

Dynamic problems like the response of a multi degree of freedom structure to external forcing and wave propagation in a medium can also be solved using the Tensor Mechanics module.

The equation of motion for a typical dynamics problem has the following format:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M \ddot{u}}+\mathbf{C \dot{u}}+\mathbf{Ku}=\mathbf{F}_{ext}
\end{equation}

Here, $\mathbf{M}$ is the mass matrix, $\mathbf{C}$ is the damping matrix, $\mathbf{K}$ is the stiffness matrix and $\mathbf{F}_{ext}$ is the vector of external forces acting at the nodes. $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{\dot{u}}$ and $\mathbf{\ddot{u}}$ are the vector of displacement, velocity and acceleration at the nodes, respectively.

## Time integration

To solve the above equation for $\mathbf{u}$, an appropriate time integration scheme needs to be chosen. Newmark [citep:newmark1959amethod] and Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT) [citep:hughes2000fem] time integration schemes are two of the commonly used methods in dynamics.

### Newmark time integration

In Newmark time integration, the acceleration and velocity at $t+\Delta t$ are written in terms of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at time $t$ and the displacement at $t+\Delta t$ using the [NewmarkAccelAux](/NewmarkAccelAux.md) and [NewmarkVelAux](/NewmarkVelAux.md) Aux Kernels, respectively.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{\ddot{u}}(t+\Delta t) &=& \frac{\mathbf{u}(t+\Delta t)-\mathbf{u}(t)}{\beta \Delta t^2}- \frac{\mathbf{\dot{u}}(t)}{\beta \Delta t}+\frac{\beta -0.5}{\beta}\mathbf{\ddot{u}}(t) \\
\mathbf{\dot{u}}(t+ \Delta t) &=& \mathbf{\dot{u}}(t)+ (1-\gamma)\Delta t \mathbf{\ddot{u}}(t) + \gamma \Delta t \mathbf{\ddot{u}}(t+\Delta t)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In the above equations, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are Newmark time integration parameters. Substituting the above two equations into the equation of motion will result in a linear system of equations ($\mathbf{Au}(t+\Delta t) = \mathbf{b}$) from which $\mathbf{u}(t+\Delta t)$ can be estimated.

- For $\beta = \frac{1}{4}$ and $\gamma = \frac{1}{2}$, the Newmark time integration method is implicit and unconditionally stable. This is the constant average acceleration method with no numerical damping. This is recommended only when a constant timestep is used throughout the simulation. If for some reason, the simulation does not converge and the timestep is halved, this time integration method with no numerical damping can result in high frequency noise.
- $\beta = \frac{1}{6}$ and $\gamma = \frac{1}{2}$ results in the linear acceleration method where the acceleration is linearly varying between $t$ and $t+\Delta t$.
- $\beta = 0$ and $\gamma = \frac{1}{2}$ is identical to the central difference method.

!alert note
For $\frac{1}{2} \le \gamma \le 2 \beta$ in structural dynamics problems, the Newmark method is unconditionally stable irrespective of the time-step $\Delta t$. For $\gamma = \frac{1}{2}$, the Newmark method is at least second order accurate; it is first order accurate for all other values of $\gamma$.

### Hilber-Hughes-Taylor time integration

The HHT time integration scheme is built upon Newmark time integration method. Here, in addition to the Newmark equations, the equation of motion is also altered resulting in:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}\mathbf{\ddot{u}}(t+\Delta t)+ \mathbf{C}[(1+\alpha)\mathbf{\dot{u}}(t+\Delta t)-\alpha\mathbf{\dot{u}}(t)] +(1+\alpha)\mathbf{K}\mathbf{u}(t+\Delta t) - \alpha K \mathbf{u}(t) = \mathbf{F}_{ext}(t+ (1 + \alpha) \Delta t)
\end{equation}

Here, $\alpha$ is the HHT parameter. For $-\frac{1}{3} \le \alpha \le 0$, $\beta = \frac{(1-\alpha)^2}{4}$ and $\gamma = \frac{1}{2} - \alpha$, the HHT method is at least second-order accurate and unconditionally stable. For non-zero values of $\alpha$, the response at high frequencies (above $\frac{1}{2 dt}$) are numerically damped, provided $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are defined as above.

More details about the Newmark method and HHT method can be found in these [lecture notes](http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/cee541/NumericalIntegration.pdf).

## Rayleigh damping

This is the most common form of structural damping used in dynamic problems. Here, the damping matrix ($\mathbf{C}$) is assumed to be a linear combination of the mass and stiffness matrices, i.e., $\mathbf{C} = \eta \mathbf{M} +\zeta\mathbf{K}$. Here, $\eta$ and $\zeta$ are the mass and stiffness dependent Rayleigh damping parameters, respectively.

The equation of motion in the presence of Rayleigh damping is:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}\mathbf{\ddot{u}}+ (\eta M + \zeta K)\mathbf{\dot{u}} +\mathbf{K}\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{F_{ext}}
\end{equation}

The degree of damping in the system depends on the coefficients $\zeta$ and $\eta$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:general_rayleigh}
\xi (\omega) = \frac{\eta}{2} \frac{1}{\omega} + \frac{\zeta}{2} \omega
\end{equation}

where, $\xi(\omega)$ is the damping ratio of the system as a function of frequency $\omega$. For example, the damping ratio as a function of frequency for $\zeta = 0.0035$ and $\eta = 0.09$ is presented in [fig:rayleigh]. Note that $\omega$ has units of rad/s and $f$ used in the figure has units of Hz.

!media media/tensor_mechanics/rayleigh.png style=width:60%;margin-left:150px;float:center; id=fig:rayleigh caption=Damping ratio as a function of frequency.

To model a constant damping ratio using Rayleigh damping, the aim is to find $\zeta$ and $\eta$ such that the $\xi(f)$ is close to the target damping ratio $\xi_t$, which is a constant value, between the frequency range $[f_1, f_2]$. This can be achieved by minimizing the difference between $\xi_t$ and $\xi(f)$ for all the frequencies between $f_1$ and $f_2$, i.e., if

\begin{equation}
I = \int_{f_1}^{f_2} \xi_t - \left(\frac{\eta}{2}\frac{1}{\omega} + \frac{\zeta}{2} \omega\right) df
\end{equation}

Then, $\frac{dI}{d \eta} = 0$ and $\frac{dI}{d \zeta}=0$ results in two equations that are linear in $\eta$ and $\zeta$. Solving these two linear equations simultaneously gives:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\zeta &= \frac{\xi_t}{2 \pi} \; \frac{3}{(\Delta f)^2} \; \left(f_1 + f_2 - 2 \frac{f_1 f_1}{\Delta f} \; ln \frac{f_2}{f_1}\right) \\
\eta &= 2 \pi \xi_t \; \frac{f_1 f_2}{\Delta_f} \; \left[ln \frac{f_2}{f_1}\; \left(2 + 6 \frac{f_1 f_2}{(\Delta_f)^2}\right) - \frac{3(f_1 + f_2)}{\Delta_f}\right]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

A similar method can be used to estimate $\eta$ and $\zeta$ for non-constant damping ratios.

## Implementation and Usage

In the MOOSE framework, the mass and stiffness matrices are not explicitly calculated. Only the residuals are calculated. To get the residual, the equation of motion (with Rayleigh damping and HHT time integration) can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\rho \ddot{u}(t+\Delta t) + \eta \rho [(1+\alpha)\dot{u}(t + \Delta t)-\alpha \dot{u}(t)] + \zeta  \nabla \cdot [(1+\alpha)\frac{d}{dt}\sigma(t+\Delta t)- \alpha \frac{d}{dt}\sigma(t)] + \nabla \cdot [(1+\alpha) \sigma(t+\Delta t) - \alpha \sigma(t)] = F_{ext}(t+ (1 + \alpha) \Delta t)
\end{equation}

Here, $\rho$ is the density of the material and $\sigma$ is the stress tensor. The weak form of the above equation is used to get the residuals.

The first two terms to the left that contain $\rho$ are calculated in the [InertialForce](/InertialForce.md) kernel. $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\eta$ need to be passed as input to the InertialForce kernel.

The next two terms to the left involving $\sigma$ are calculated in [DynamicStressDivergenceTensors](/DynamicStressDivergenceTensors.md).

Note that the time derivative of $\sigma(t+\Delta t)$ and $\sigma(t)$ are approximated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dt}\sigma(t+\Delta t) &= \frac{\sigma(t+\Delta t)-\sigma(t)}{\Delta t} \\
\frac{d}{dt}\sigma(t) &= \frac{\sigma(t)-\sigma(t-\Delta t)}{\Delta t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The input file syntax for calculating the residual due to both the Inertial force and the DynamicStressDivergenceTensors is:

!listing modules/tensor_mechanics/test/tests/dynamics/rayleigh_damping/rayleigh_hht.i start=Kernels end=AuxKernels

Here, `./DynamicTensorMechanics` is the action that calls the [DynamicStressDivergenceTensors](/DynamicStressDivergenceTensors.md) kernel.

Finally, when using HHT time integration method, external forces like gravity and pressure also require $\alpha$ as input.

!alert note
For dynamic problems, it is recommended to use [PresetDisplacement](/PresetDisplacement.md) and [PresetAcceleration](/PresetAcceleration.md) for prescribing the displacement and acceleration at a boundary, respectively.

!alert warning
[DynamicStressDivergenceTensors](/DynamicStressDivergenceTensors.md) uses the undisplaced mesh by default but kernels such as [InertialForce](/InertialForce.md) and [Gravity](/Gravity.md), and boundary conditions such as [Pressure](/Pressure.md) use the displaced mesh by default. All calculations should be performed either using the undisplaced mesh (recommended for small strain problems) or the displaced mesh (recommended for finite strain problems). Therefore, `use_displaced_mesh` parameter should be appropriately set for all the kernels and boundary conditions.

## Static Initialization

To initialize the system under a constant initial loading such as gravity, an initial static analysis can be conducted by turning off all the dynamics related Kernels and AuxKernels such as [InertialForce](/InertialForce.md), [NewmarkVelAux](/NewmarkVelAux.md) and [NewmarkAccelAux](/NewmarkAccelAux.md) for the first time step. To turn off stiffness proportional Rayleigh damping for the first time step `static_initialization` flag can be set to true in [DynamicTensorMechanics](/DynamicTensorMechanicsAction.md) or [DynamicStressDivergenceTensors](/DynamicStressDivergenceTensors.md). An example of static initialization can be found in this following test:
