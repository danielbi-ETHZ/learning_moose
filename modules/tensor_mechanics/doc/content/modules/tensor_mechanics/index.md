# Tensor Mechanics Module

- [System Documentation List](tensor_mechanics/systems.md)

The Tensor Mechanics module is a library of simulation tools that solve
continuum mechanics problems. It provides a simple approach for implementing
even advanced mechanics models:

- Plug-n-play design enables users to incorporate the relevant physics for specific and varied simulations
- Tensor implementation matches mathematical theory
- Straight-forward procedure for adding new physics

The tensor mechanics system can be used to simulation both linear and finite strain mechanics, including
Elasticity and Cosserat elasticity, Plasticity and micromechanics plasticity, Creep, and
Damage due to cracking and property degradation

## Explore the Capabilities and Start Modeling

The +Tensor Mechanics module+ is used in a variety of pure mechanics simulations
and in combined physics simulations with the Heat Transfer, Phase Field, Contact,
Porous Flow, and XFEM modules; use the MOOSE combined module to perform simulations
with multiple physics modules. The following figures show results from a few
different simulations performed by tensor mechanics module users.

The tensor mechanics module is being developed by users at national laboratories
and universities around the world. Contact the developers through the
[moose-users email list](help/contact_us.md optional=True).

## Developing New Tensor Mechanics Code

Consider becoming a developer yourself.
The tensor mechanics module uses code syntax based on tensor forms. This approach
allows the constitutive tensor equations to be implemented, clearly and concisely,
in the same format as written in mathematical notation.
Follow the MOOSE standards for [contributing code and documentation](MooseDocs/generate.md optional=True).
