# Rank Two Scalar Aux

!syntax description /AuxKernels/RankTwoScalarAux

## Description

The AuxKernel `RankTwoScalarAux` provides methods to calculate several different scalar quantities
for a Rank-2 tensor, described below.  In some types of calculations, the scalar quantity is
calculated in a user-specified direction (by default set to the (0, 0, 1) axis); in other calculation
types the user can specify the start and end points of a line along which the scalar quantity is
calculated.  Quantities commonly examined with `RankTwoScalarAux` are stress ($\boldsymbol{\sigma}$)
and strain ($\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$).

If desired, `RankTwoScalarAux` can be restricted to calculate the scalar quantity data for a Rank-2
tensor at a single specified quadrature point per element. This option is generally used only for
debugging purposes.

## Axial Stress

The scalar type `AxialStress` calculates the scalar value of a Rank-2 tensor, $T$, in the direction
of the axis specified by the user.  The user should give the starting point, $P^1$, and the end
point, $P^2$ which define the axis.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:axial_stress_scalar_type}
s = \hat{a}_i T_{ij} \hat{a}_j \quad \text{ where } \quad \hat{a}_i = \frac{P^2_i - P^1_i}{\left| P^2_i - P^1_i \right|}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{a}$ is the normalized direction vector for the axis defined by the points $P^1$ and $P^2$.

## Direction

The scalar type `direction` calculates the scalar value of a Rank-2 tensor, $T$, in the direction
selected by the user as shown by [eq:direction_scalar_type]:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:direction_scalar_type}
s = D_i T_{ij} D_j
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the direction vector specified in the input file.

### Example Input File Syntax

!listing modules/tensor_mechanics/test/tests/elastic_patch/elastic_patch.i block=AuxKernels/direction

An AuxVariable is required to store the AuxKernel information. Note that the name of the AuxVariable
is used as the argument for the `variable` input parameter in the `RankTwoScalarAux` block.

!listing modules/tensor_mechanics/test/tests/elastic_patch/elastic_patch.i block=AuxVariables/direction

## Effective Strain

The scalar type `EffectiveStrain` calculates an effective scalar measure of a Rank-2 tensor, often
strain ($\epsilon_{ij}$) according to [eq:effective_strain_scalar_type].
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:effective_strain_scalar_type}
s = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3} \epsilon_{ij} \epsilon_{ij}}
\end{equation}

!alert warning title=This Strain Measure is not for Inelastic Strains
This effective strain measure, `EffectiveStrain`, should not be confused with the effective plastic strain or effective creep strain, which are computed as integrals over the history of the inelastic strain; these effective inelastic strain measures are computed as scalar material properties (named `effective_plastic_strain` and `effective_creep_strain`) for applicable $J_2$ models. The effective inelastic strains are computed as:
\begin{equation}
s = \int_t\sqrt{\frac{2}{3} \dot{\epsilon}^p_{ij} \dot{\epsilon}^p_{ij}} \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
where $t$ is time and $\dot{\epsilon}^p_{ij}$ is the inelastic strain increment.

## Hoop Stress

The scalar type `HoopStress` calculates the value of a Rank-2 tensor along the hoop direction of a
cylinder, shown in [eq:hoop_stress_scalar_type].  The cylinder is defined with a normal
vector from the current position to the cylinder surface and a user specified axis of rotation.  The
user defines this rotation axis with a starting point, $P^1$, and the end point, $P^2$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hoop_stress_scalar_type}
s = \hat{n}^h_i T_{ij} \hat{n}^h_j
\end{equation}
where $\hat{n}^h$ is the hoop direction normal, defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hoop_direction_normal}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{n}^h & = \hat{n}^c \times \hat{a} \\
    \hat{n}^c & = \frac{P^c - \hat{n}^r}{\left| P^c - \hat{n}^r \right|} \\
    \hat{a} & = \frac{P^2 - P^1}{\left| P^2 - P^1 \right|}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $P^c$ is the current sampling position point, and $\hat{n}^r$ is the direction normal to the plane defined by the cylinder axis of rotation vector and the direction normal to the axis of rotation at the current position $P^c$.

tensor, using the calcEigenValues method from the Rank Two Tensor utility class.

#### Example Input File Syntax

direction of the normal vector from the user-defined axis of rotation, as shown in
[eq:radial_stress_scalar_type].
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:radial_stress_scalar_type}
s = \hat{n}^r_i T_{ij} \hat{n}^r_j
\end{equation}
where $\hat{n}^r$ is the direction normal to the plane defined by the cylinder axis of rotation
vector and the direction normal to the axis of rotation at the current position $P^c$.

## Triaxiality Stress

The scalar type `TriaxialityStress` finds the ratio of the hydrostatic measure, $T_{hydrostatic}$, to
the von Mises measure, $T_{vonMises}$, as shown in [eq:triaxiality_scalar_type].  As the
name suggests, this scalar measure is most often used for stress tensors.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:triaxiality_scalar_type}
s = \frac{T_{hydrostatic}}{T_{vonMises}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} T_{ii}}{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2} S_{ij} S_{ij}}}
\end{equation}
where $S_{ij}$ is the deviatoric tensor of the Rank-2 tensor $T_{ij}$.

## Volumetric Strain

The scalar type `VolumetricStrain` computes the volumetric strain, defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:volumetric_strain}
\varepsilon_{vol} = \frac{\Delta V}{V}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta V$ is the change in volume and $V$ is the original volume.

This calculation assumes that the strains supplied as input ($T$) are logarithmic strains,
which are by definition $log(L/L_0)$, where $L$ is the current length and $L_0$
is the original length of a line segment in a given direction.
The ratio of the volume change of a strained cube to the original volume is thus:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:volumetric_strain_from_tensor}
s = \frac{\Delta V}{V} = \exp(T_{11}) * \exp(T_{22}) * \exp(T_{33}) - 1
\end{equation}
This is the value computed as the volumetric strain.


!alert! note title=Finite strain effects
This calculation assumes that the supplied Rank-2 tensor $T_{ij}$ is a logarithmic strain, which is
the strain quantity computed for finite strain calculations. The small-strain equivalent of this
calculation would be
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:volumetric_strain_small_strain}
s = T_{11} + T_{22} + T_{33}
\end{equation}
which assumes that engineering strains are supplied and ignores higher-order terms. There is currently
no option to compute this small-strain form of the volumetric strain because at small strains, the
differences between the finite strain form used and the small strain approximation is small.

## Von Mises Stress

The scalar type `VonMisesStress` calculates the vonMises measure for a Rank-2 tensor, as shown in
[eq:vonmises_scalar_type].  This quantity is usually applied to the stress tensor.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vonmises_scalar_type}
s = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2} S_{ij} S_{ij}}
\end{equation}
where $S_{ij}$ is the deviatoric tensor of the Rank-2 tensor $T_{ij}$.

### Example Input File Syntax

         block=AuxKernels/vonmises

         block=AuxVariables/vonmises

As with the [RankTwoAux](/RankTwoAux.md) AuxKernel, `RankTwoScalarAux` requires the inclusion of an
AuxVariable block for each AuxKernel block.

## AuxVariable Order

!alert! note title=Elemental vs Nodal Visualization of Quadrature Field Values
Results will have different quality based on the AuxVariable:

- +Elemental Constant Monomial+ Using an AuxVariable with `family = MONOMIAL` and `order = CONSTANT` will give a constant value of
  the AuxVariable for the entire element, which is computed by taking a volume-weighted average of the integration
  point quantities. This is the default option using TensorMechanics Action and requires the least computational cost.
- +Elemental Higher-order Monomial+ Using an AuxVariable with `family = MONOMIAL` and `order = FIRST` or higher will result in
  fields that vary linearly (or with higher order) within each element. Because the Exodus mesh format does not
  support higher-order elemental variables, these AuxVariables are output by libMesh as nodal variables for visualization
  purposes. Using higher order monomial variables in this way can produce smoother visualizations of results for a properly
  converged simulation.
- +Nodal Lagrange+ Using an AuxVariable with `family = LAGRANGE` will result in a smooth nodal field of the material property,
  constructed using [nodal patch recovery](nodal_patch_recovery.md optional=True).
  `patch_polynomial_order` is set to equal the order of the AuxVariable by default.
  Use this option for the best (smoothest, most accurate) results, but there is
  some additional computational cost. Furthermore, this method is suitable +only
  for serial simulations+ at present.
