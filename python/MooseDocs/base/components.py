    # Overview
    TokenComponent objects are designed to be created by Extension objects and added to the Reader
    object in the Extension:extend method. The purpose of a TokenComponent is to define a regular
    expression, that when match returns a token that is added to the AST.

    The codebase of MooseDocs (Translator, Reader, Renderer) is certainly capable of tokenizing
    arbitrary formats. However, the primary use case is for creating HTML so there are a certain
    features for this class that are setup with that application in mind.

    ## RE Class Member
    The RE class member variable is used for convenience to
    allow for derived classes to avoid creating an __init__ method. As shown in core.py the purpose
    of this class is to be able to add parser syntax for tokenizing with a minimal amount code, the
    following static member variables aid in the design goal.

    RE must be defined as a compile re expressions that captures the content to be converted to a
    token within the createToken method.  - TOKEN: The token type (not instance) that will be
    created

    ## Settings
    If the supplied regex match option has a group named "settings" these settings will be
    automatically parsed by the translator and used to update the values returned by the
    defaultSettings method. These settings must be key-value pairings that use an equal sign that is
    does not contains spaces on either side (e.g., foo=bar).

    The automatic parsing settings may be disable by setting the PARSE_SETTINGS class member
    variable to False in the child object.
