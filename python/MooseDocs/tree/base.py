class NodeBase(anytree.NodeMixin):
    """
    Base class for tree nodes that accepts arbitrary attributes.

    The class behaves as a dict(), with respect to accessing the attributes.

    Inputs:
        parent[NodeBase]: The parent Node (use None for the root)
        name[str]: The name of the node.
        **kwargs: Arbitrary key, value pairs that are added to the __dict__ by the anytree.Node
                  class. These are accessible

    IMPORTANT: In a previous version of MOOSEDocs there was a property system that did automatic
               setters and getters with type checking and slew of other clever things. Well the
               cleverness was too slow. The constructor of these objects is called a lot, so the
               checking was hurting performance.

         NOTE: The anytree.NodeMixin was used rather than anytree.Node, which also supports
               arbitrary attributes, because it constructed a bit faster and accessing the
               attributes in anytree.Node is done via "." operator, which is less obvious than using
               dictionary items.
